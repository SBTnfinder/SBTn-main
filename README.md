# SBTn-main

New type of SBT attached to an NFT instead of a wallet, with multiple use cases such as gaming, metaverse and more. Increasing the added value of the attached NFT.

## Idea

The idea behind SBTn is to be an a SBT connected to a NFT not to a wallet. This make possible a lot of things that doesn't even exist in the actual web 3.0, like registration, evolution, unique things, etc.
